# bollywood
In early childhoods we used to play a game called bollywood where one person gave a movie to be guessed and other person guesed the letters and hence the movie.
It works as follows:
REQUIREMENTS:At least two players
How to play:
1st player enters the movie to be guessed
The code generates an automatic string for the movie to be guessed in the following manner:
a)Vowels get placed automatically.
b)'/'acts as the separator in case the movie has more than one word.
c)'*' need to be replaced with the guessed letters
Now 2nd player makes the guesses of the letters
a)if the guess is right then the string will place that guess in the right place
b)if guess is wrong one letter out of "BOLLYWOOD" will be trimmed in a sequential manner till no letter is left.
Happy Gaming!!!!!!
